*The following are responses to the questions therefor it is not in code*
I can describe the ants beahvior as I saw it in the simualtion on how the react to different phermones when there is food

The parament that produced successful forging behavior was the foodPheromoneDepositRate, the homePheromoneEvaporationRate
and the antSpped.
