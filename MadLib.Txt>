// Structure of MadLib
Today I woke up and discovered a giant (animal) in my (room of the house).
It was wearing a (piece of clothing) and eating a giant (food) while humming the song (song title).
I tried to chase it away with a (object), but instead it shouted
“(silly phrase)!” and jumped onto my (piece of furniture).
Then my (family member) walked in, looked at the chaos, and calmly said
“This is nothing compared to the time I fought a (mythical creature) with only a (random household item).”
At that point I decided the only solution was to (verb) until everything smelled like (weird smell).
Needless to say it was the most (adjective) Tuesday of my life.

// to make sure it is input correctly 
func prompt(_ message: String) -> String {
    print(message, terminator: " ")
    return readLine() ?? ""
